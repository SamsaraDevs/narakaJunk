=========================
- Admiral Tfear, the villain for the Security Officer, has been added.
- Converted all damage factors to HP. The Cyberdemon has the highest HP of all.

- D'Sparil's summon was changed from spawning Disciples from one of D'Sparil's missiles to spawning directly from D'Sparil.
- The Disciples of D'Sparil no longer regard their master as a threat.
- The bulky and large size of the villains means moving in formation isn't quite as easy. Now the villains can pass through each other, like co-op players can.

- Readjusted and tweaked Chaos Serpent death sequences--hopefully D'Sparil no longer gets stuck after his Chaos Serpent dies.

- D'Sparil's Disciples now only drop Lesser Tomes of Power, though with 4x the drop rate.
- D'Sparil on foot no longer has +NOTARGET, which means enemies should go after him again.

- The Cyberdemon's frozen death was not playing his frozen sound. Now he does.
- The Staff of D'Sparil is no longer kept between lives or levels.
