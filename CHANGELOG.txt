FROM CONCEPT V0 TO V0.1:
=========================
- Admiral Tfear, the villain for the Security Officer, has been added.
- Converted all damage factors to HP. The Cyberdemon has the highest HP of all.
- The Cyberdemon now no longer can be hurt by D'Sparil's Disciples.
- D'Sparil's summon was changed from spawning Disciples from one of D'Sparil's missiles to spawning directly from D'Sparil.
- The Disciples of D'Sparil no longer regard their master as a threat.
- The bulky and large size of the villains means moving in formation isn't quite as easy. Now the villains can pass through each other, like co-op players can.
- D'Sparil no longer randomly resurrects himself again, after he was already resurrected.
- Readjusted and tweaked Chaos Serpent death sequences--hopefully D'Sparil no longer gets stuck after his Chaos Serpent dies.
- The SBarInfo has been updated to accomodate both D'Sparil and on-foot D'Sparil. Picking D'Sparil should no longer get people an HoM.
- The SBarInfo has been updated, and now everyone has a psuedo-proper HUD.
- The Radius of the bosses have been decreased to 16--now they can go through all the tunnels the heroes can, though they may need to crouch for it first.
- The environmental damage resistance of the Villains has been changed from an actor inheriting from PowerIronFeet to a DamageFactor 0 against Slime and Lava.
- D'Sparil's Disciples now only drop Lesser Tomes of Power, though with 4x the drop rate.
- D'Sparil on foot no longer has +NOTARGET, which means enemies should go after him again.
- If D'Sparil on foot had died or gone to the next level, the Chaos Serpent would have his items. No longer.
- The Cyberdemon's frozen death was not playing his frozen sound. Now he does.
- The Staff of D'Sparil is no longer kept between lives or levels.
- The bosses now have translations and can switch between colors. At the moment, this does not take D'Sparil on foot into account.
- The Cyberdemon's stomp has a larger radius, now.
- The Cyberdemon's rockets, body, and sounds have been added, and thus now he can be used in Heretic, HeXen, and other such iwads.
- The Cyberdemon's stomp no longer kills allies.
- The Cyberdemon's stomp has a proper obituary attached to it.
- The Cyberdemon's rockets fire slightly slower.
- The Cyberdemon now has a temporary sprint, which can help him overrun others or get away from a bad situation.
- D'Sparil's Chaos Serpent's alt-fire's first wave of fireballs no longer uses the primary fire's stats.
- The villains now have a co-op mode, as requested by Zael and PresidentPeople. However, their shots only go through other villains! They do not get along with the heroes!
- When firing the trio burst of rockets, the Cyberdemon now stands still in order to absorb the recoil, like in Doom.
- All of the villains, sans D'Sparil's Chaos Serpent, now run off ammo.
