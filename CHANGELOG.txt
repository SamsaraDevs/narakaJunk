FROM v0.12 TO v0.13:
========================
- Pfhor no longer repeat the victim's name in place of the killer's name.
- The Team Balancer no longer checks to see if there are X amount of player in the game. Instead, it checks if X amount of players are on either team. This should result in much more lenient balancing when there's a small number of players.
- Joining the game at the last minute no longer breaks the balancer.
- Hitler now always gains his speed boost when he loses his mech.
- Tfear's Flawed no longer uses the SYSTEM ERROR obituary.
- Minions now have +FRIENDLY in the co-op version, which means they should now attack enemy monsters.
- Hitler's 10% damage resistance buff now only takes effect in co-op play as his "Beef" item.
- D'Sparil's cooldown for his summon and Chaos Device has been doubled--but whenever he enters his Pain State when on-foot, the cooldown is shortened slightly. This should reward more aggressive D'Sparils and slow down those who simply teleport, summon, and repeat.
- Likewise, Tfear's cooldown for his Beacon has been doubled, and whenever he enters his Pain state the cooldown is shortened.
- Tfear's questionable shotgun-esque alt-fire for the Abandon has been replaced with a more-suitable-for-the-role remote grenade launcher.
- The powerups for the Shotgun and the Chaingun have been replaced with something more useful--very slight armor and health regeneration.
- The pickup messages have been reworked so that people actually know what you're getting on picking them up.
- D'Sparil, Korax, and Cyberdemon are now less resistant to Duke's explosives. Hitler is now slightly more resistant.
- By massive request, Disciples no longer drop Lesser Tomes of Power. Bye bye, awesome book. ;_;
- All of the Villains (sans D'Sparil due to technical issues) now have different colors across their life/armor bar to represent how much they have.
- Due to popular demand, Hitler's obituary has been changed.
- naraka_ban[class], naraka_[class]defense, and naraka_[class]damage have been imported. If you think a class is too OP, UP, or broken, now you have control over them!
- Tfear now has a HUD graphic composed of Marathon Pfhor textures.
- When sv_weaponstay is enabled, villains get a flash on their screen when they pick up a powerup.
- The Villains now have their respective individual colors, like the Heroes do.
- The team balancer has been turned into a cvar, naraka_teambalancer. 0 does not attempt to balance the teams at all, 1 favors Heroes but allows Villains to have equal numbers with the heroes if desired, 2 is more strict and does not allow Villains to have equal numbers. Defaults to 1.
- Team balancer should no longer take effect when people are respawning.
- After picking up a certain number of backpacks, Heroes are no longer unable to pick up any more ammo.
- Tfear's beacon limiter now no longer exists for his Pfhor Troopers, thanks to lack of APROP_MASTERTID. To make up for it, they are slightly less triggerhappy, always trigger their painchance, and have less HP.
- Tfear's beacon now no longer summons TLMS minions in coop.
- D'Sparil's minions can no longer be revived by Archviles.
- When respawning, unarmored Hitler no longer loses his speed boost.
- In coop, Hitler's armored/unarmored damage per volley has been increased from 24/12 to 36/18.
- Hitler's weapons now have the Villain damagetype, meaning they should no longer injure allied minions.
- When D'Sparil's Serpent is killed in coop, D'Sparil was not shifting species to "Player". This has been fixed.
- Villain HUDs now support Super Turbo Turkey Puncher 3000.
- In coop, minions should now be immune to: DukeExplosive, Explosive, BFGSpray, Zorch, BJSpear, HexenIce, Poison, PoisonCloud, FireExplosive, Wraithverge, MightyBoot, DukeFreezethrower, WMCBeam, WMCNade, Chainsaw, TimonsAxe, Pistol, CorvusHellstaff, ZorchPistol, and Telefrag. While its not EVERYTHING they can be hit with, it should dramatically reduce their able-to-be-TK'd potential.
- Minions no longer can activate teleports or Monster Crosses lines.
- Minions no longer can go beyond monster boundaries.
- Fiery attacks from Villains now have the VillainTeamFire damagetype, which should cause the appropriate burn death in Heroes.

- Minions no longer bring Invasion to a screeching halt.
- Up to seven Pfhor Troopers can now be summoned. Their max damage range has been decreased from 15 to 10, and their accuracy decreased.\n\

- The Disciples of D'Sparil no longer regard their master as a threat.

- Readjusted and tweaked Chaos Serpent death sequences--hopefully D'Sparil no longer gets stuck after his Chaos Serpent dies.

- If D'Sparil on foot had died or gone to the next level, the Chaos Serpent would have his items. No longer.
- The Cyberdemon's frozen death was not playing his frozen sound. Now he does.
- The Staff of D'Sparil is no longer kept between lives or levels.
